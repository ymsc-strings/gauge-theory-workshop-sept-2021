## OPE Coefficients in ABJM Theory with Giants by Yunfeng Jiang

In this talk, I will discuss a family of three-point functions in ABJM theory, both at weak and strong coupling. This family of three-point functions involve two BPS sub-determinant operators called giant gravitons and one single trace operator, which can be BPS or non-BPS. In the first part of the talk, I will explain how to compute this type of three-point functions at weak coupling using a large $N$ effective field theory. The structure constant is given by the overlap of an integrable matrix product state and a Bethe state. In the second part, I will first clarify the prescription at strong coupling by considering examples in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. I will show that it is important to perform an average over the moduli space and also take into account the contributions from wave functions. These prescriptions are tested by a highly non-trivial matching of the structure constants at weak and strong couplings in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. We then apply this prescription to ABJM theory and give concrete predictions at strong coupling.

## 3d N=4 Unitary/Orthosymplectic Duality by Satoshi Nawata

There are two ways to realize 3d N=4 Sp(k) SQCDs in Type IIB string theory: either O3^+ plane or O5^- plane. The mirror dual to the O3^+ plane realization is an orthosymplectic quiver theory whereas the mirror dual to the O5^- plane realization is a unitary quiver theory. Using exact partition functions, we will show that these two mirror theories are dual to each other, and we also reveal brane dynamics with O-plane.  Similarly, considering 5d N=1 Sp(k) SQCDs at the infinite coupling limit, the magnetic quiver techniques find a pair of 3d N=4 unitary and orthosymplectic quiver with the same Higgs and Coulomb branch. We also discuss the duality between these magnetic quivers. I will end the talk with lots of open problems, expecting insightful feedbacks from audiences. This is about ongoing joint work with M. Sperling, Z. Zhong, and H. Wang.

## Penrose Limit: A Stringy Regime in Holography by Minxin Huang

Penrose limit provides a promising avenue to the stringy regime in the AdS/CFT holography, giving rise to the pp-wave background. Recently, we proposed a novel entry of the pp-wave holographic dictionary, which equated the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase  (BMN)  two-point functions in free Yang-Mills theory with the norm squares of the quantum unitary transition amplitudes between the corresponding tensionless strings. If our proposal is correct, it would not only provide first examples of systematic calculations of the higher genus critical superstring amplitudes, but may also in principle gives exact complete results for any string coupling, due to the convergence of genus expansion.
